## 📌 Project Overview

The **AI Powered Customer Retention System** is a Machine Learning web application that predicts whether a telecom customer is likely to churn or stay with the company.

This system helps telecom organizations identify high-risk customers and take proactive retention actions to reduce customer loss and improve business growth.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges faced by telecom companies.

Acquiring a new customer costs much more than retaining an existing customer. Therefore, predicting churn in advance enables organizations to take preventive actions and improve customer retention.

## 🔧 Data Preprocessing

### Missing Value Handling

✔ Numerical Features → Median Imputation

✔ Categorical Features → Mode Imputation

### Categorical Encoding

#### One Hot Encoding

- Gender
- Partner
- Dependents

#### Ordinal Encoding

- Phone Service
- Internet Service
- Online Security
- Online Backup
- Device Protection
- Tech Support
- Streaming TV
- Streaming Movies
- Contract Type
- Payment Method

## 📈 Feature Engineering

### Variable Transformation

✔ Yeo-Johnson Transformation

Used to reduce skewness and improve feature distribution.

Examples:

- tenure_yeo_tri
- TotalCharges_rep_yeo_CapMS

### Outlier Handling

Applied robust outlier treatment techniques to minimize the impact of extreme values.

---

## 🎯 Feature Selection

### Variance Threshold

Removed low variance and quasi-constant features.

### Pearson Correlation

Selected statistically significant features using correlation analysis and p-values.

---

## ⚖ Data Balancing

### SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)

Benefits:

- Handles class imbalance
- Improves Recall
- Better churn detection
- Reduces model bias

---

## 🤖 Model Used

### Logistic Regression

Configuration:

```python
LogisticRegression(
    penalty='l2',
    solver='sag'
)
```

Advantages:

✔ Fast

✔ Interpretable

✔ Suitable for Binary Classification

✔ Good Generalization
